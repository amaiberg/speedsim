    <string name="VaccCommModel"><b>Vaccinated Communites\n\n</b>Epidemiological model of a community-structured population with
        vaccination. Each column in the lattice image represents a different community.  Communities
        can have different vaccination levels.  Infected individuals contact others within their
        same community, or from among the entire population, to attempt infection. The probability
        of a contact being long-distance (not within one\'s own community) is given by \'alpha\'. If
        the target is susceptible and unvaccinated, it becomes infected. Susceptible vaccinated targets
        may or may not become infected, based on the given \'vaccine effectivess\' probability. Upon
        recovery, individuals become susceptible again at the given \'loss of resistance\' rate.</string>
        
    <string name="DynamicLandModel"><b>Dynamic Landscape\n\n</b>This is a population model where some efforts are being made
        to control the population.  For example, it might model the application of pesticides over
        a given landscape.  Pesticide is applied to blocks of sites, e.g. 3x4 blocks of sites at
        once (the block size is controlled by the two block size sliders). The overall per-site
        disturbance rate is held constant, even as the block size is changed. Pesticide is applied
        at the given \'disturbance rate\' per site; the pesticide dissipates and wears off at the
        specified \'regrowth rate\'. </string>
    <string name="VantsModel"><b>Vants\n\n</b>In a world consisting only of black and white tiles, there exist two types of
        creatures: Vants (virtual ants) and Antivants. At each time step a Vant steps forward onto a new tile and then makes a
        decision according to two simple rules:\nIf the new tile is white, the Vant colors the tile black and
        turns 90 degrees to the right.\nIf the new tile is black, the Vant colors the tile white and turns 90 degrees
        to the left.\nAntivants follow the same rules, except that they turn left instead of right and vice versa. This model
        demonstrates how very simple deterministic rules can result in extremely complex behavior.</string>

    <string name="AboutThisAppText">The first few models on the previous screen are called \'Cellular Automatons.\'  You can
         think of a cellular automaton model as a piece of graph paper, with many small squares, called cells. Each cell can
         have one of several colors. Or instead of colors, you could use numbers to describe the value in each cell (the values
          are called \'states\').\n\tThe squares are updated as follows: A clock ticks regularly, and on every tick of the clock 
          (every \'time step\'), each cell examines its own value, and the values of some of its neighbors. It uses those values, 
          and follows a kind of recipe or rule, which describes what its new state will be after the clock-tick. Every cell does
           this simultaneously, using its own value and the values of some of its neighbors, to compute its new value. They then
            change their state to their new values, all at once.\n\tIt sounds somewhat abstract, but cellular automata models 
            have been used for many things, from simple attractive \'screen savers\', to studying the theory of computation, 
            to modeling phenomena in physics, ecology/biology, geology, and fluid flow.\n\nThe other models listed implement 
            some computational models based on the work of the SPEED Lab research group at the University of Maine. SPEED stands
           for Spatial Population Ecological and Epidemiological Dynamics.  Research efforts of the group focus on computational 
           and mathematical models of populations spread across landscapes. These landscapes often include different types of 
           habitat, arranged in various types of patterns. Planned applications of the models include modeling the spread of 
           plants in forested landscapes, agricultural crop pests such as maggot flies in commercial blueberry fields in Maine 
           with pesticides being applied in various patterns, and other invasive species such as Asian woodwasps. The models are 
           also being applied toward studying the spread of malicious software such as computer worms or viruses in networks, as 
           such software often uses biologically-inspired dispersal strategies.  The models included in the app apply to studies 
           of infection spread, multiscale dispersal, and the impact of clustered vaccination on outbreak levels.\n\tIn addition 
           to the \'Lattice\' or grid view, models also plot the proportion of sites in each state. Tap the arrow buttons
           to switch views. Views include model parameters, plot, description, and drawing. Drawing on the lattice is permitted. 
           Try tapping or dragging your finger across the lattice.  You can change the drawing brush size 
           and color in the drawing view.</string>
